         There is no shortcut for hard work that lead to effectiveness.<br>
         You must stay disciplined because most of the work is behind the scenes<br>
         Laziness is a luxurious mindset that I can not afford to own<br>
         it takes many years to become an overnight success <br>
    </p1>
<br>
<br>
    <p2> 
         Have a goal. Work towards it. Because there is not a thing,<br>
         more fulfilling than reaping the fruits of your labour<br>
         Hardwork doesnot break bones,<br>
         it rather strengthens the body and mind<br>
    </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p3>
         Nothing comes easy.You want something in life?<br>
         Get off your comfort zone and work for it.<br>
         It takes many years to become an overnight success,<br>
         victory only comes through wear and tear<br>
    </p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p4> 
         A lot of hard workers fall short of success because,<br>
         they dont understand that working hard only pays off <br>
         when, it is channeled on the right plan of action<br>
         If you want to clout, work for it <br>
    </p4>
    <br>

    <p5> 
         HardWork! HardWork!! HardWork!!!<br>
